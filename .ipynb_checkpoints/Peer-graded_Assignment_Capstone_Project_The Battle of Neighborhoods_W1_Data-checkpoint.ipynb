    " The Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Sri_Lanka is the main source of data that is being used to obtain all the districts of Sri Lanka. I have used BeautifulSoup library to scrape required data from the above link. Then Iâ€™ve extracted the required tables from the above page and converted it into a pandas data frame.\n",

    " Data scraped from multiple sources were combined into one table. I ran a code to find whether there are NaN values in the dataset. As well as there were many unwanted columns in the data frame that I initially made after scraping data from the Website. So I dropped unwanted columns and renamed columns for ease and created a new data frame. With the help of geopy library, I could get the latitude and longitude details related to particular district and merged it with the data frame I created lately. The final data set after cleaning consists of single data frame with 6 columns containing Province, latitudes & longitudes of a particular district. Other columns like Population, Population density which also been scraped from the website which can be used for further analysis. \n",
